DRI-HOP
Direct Relief Integration for Higher Optical Performance. ArcGIS 10 - Python 2.7 code for better integration of shaded relief with colored geologic map-unit polygons

This is a single-tool ArcMap toolbox for explicitly controlling how shaded relief and colored map-unit polygons are integrated. Typically, in ArcMap, color over shaded relief is implemented by making the colored polygon layer (or the shaded-relief layer) semi transparent and drawing it over the other layer. The net effect is to reduce the overall color gamut.  See DRI-HOP.html (an html transcription of the tool interface) for more information. 

The tool is designed to run off a GeMS-style map database (see https://ngmdb.usgs.gov/Info/standards/GeMS/) in which Symbol values refer to wpgcmyk.style.
